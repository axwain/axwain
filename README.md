I'm a software engineer with 9+ years of experience doing mostly front-end work at my job. Currently, I'm using React, Typescript, and AWS at my job, and learning Go, and C with side projects.

Despite having worked mostly with UI implementations and in the web realm, I don't shy away from trying new things. I let my curiosity lead the way and I end up doing unexpected tasks. This has enabled for me the possibility of being able to work beyond just web frontends.

Currently, due to some personal circumstances, I'll have to stick working with web front-ends, but I hope in the near future to be able to pivot to work in other areas that allow me to learn and try new things, and be with harder challenges.
